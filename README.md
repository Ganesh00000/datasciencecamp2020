The MS Estonia was a car and passenger ferry that was sailing from Estonia to Sweden with 989 passengers and crew when bad weather and heavy seas caused it to sink off the coast of Finland.

A crew member who survived the accident told the BBC at the time that he had seen a loading bay door open and taking in water minutes before the ship sank.

People from 17 countries lost their lives in the disaster. Of the 852 people killed, 501 were Swedish and 285 were Estonian.

The Estonia disaster is the second-deadliest peacetime sinking of a European ship after the Titanic.
